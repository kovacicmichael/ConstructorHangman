//need a constructor that contains
	//string value to underlying value for the character
	//boolean to see if it has been guessed
	//a function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
	//A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
